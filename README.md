# Destination Station
This project is part of our (see contributors) semester project at Fontys during the AI specialization in collaboration with Ordina.

## Context 
The team will be collaborating with Oridina during the project phase, the company is a local independent IT service company in the Benelux with approximately 2650 employees. Most consultants worked on projects and assignments at the customerâ€™s location spread throughout the Netherlands. The company stimulates their employees to travel sustainably, this means via train or electrical vehicle. 

The issue the company faces dealing  with train transport is the inconsistency of it, trains may face delays, redirections or other subjected transfers or delays. 

The client wants the team to create an application that deals with calculating and predicting delays and redirections. The focus is to provide insight in possible delays, and how this may impact travel time and estimated time of arrival, with the necessary transfers if required. 

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict possible delays in the arrival of trains so that Ordina employees can travel punctually and sustainably to their clients.
